\section{Introduction}

If an unknown quantity $\x$ has a discrete probability distribution $p(\x)$,
the entropy is
\begin{align}
H_{\x} &= -\sum_{\x} p(\x) \log p(\x)
\end{align}
where the sum is over all of the possible values of $\x$ under consideration.
This probability distribution is implicitly conditional on some prior
information, which is have omitted from the notation.

\section{Entropies in Bayesian inference}

In a standard situation where Bayesian inference would be used,
the unknown quantities are the parameters $\x$ and the data $\d$
(which subsequently becomes known). The prior information leads the
user to specify a prior distribution $p(\x)$ for the unknown parameters,
along with a ``sampling distribution'' $p(\d | \x)$ describing prior knowledge
of how the data is related to the parameters. By the product rule, this yields
a joint prior
\begin{align}
p(\x, \d) &= p(\x)p(\d | \x)
\end{align}


\subsection{The relevance of data}

The degree to which the question ``what is the value of $\x$?'' is
answered by the question ``what is the value of $\d$?'' is given by the
conditional entropy
\begin{align}
H_{\x | \d} &= - \sum_{\d} p(\d) \sum_{\x} p(\x | \d) \log p(\x | \d)
\end{align}
which is the expected value of the entropy of the posterior, averaged over
all possible datasets which might be observed.


\section{Nested Sampling}
Nested Sampling \citep[NS][]{skilling2006nested}


\subsection{The sequence of $X$ values}
When $N=1$, the sequence of $X$ values is a Poisson process.

\citet{Walter2015} showed how this property can be used to construct a
version of NS that produces unbiased estimates of the marginal likelihood.
However, it can be used to construct an unbiased estimator of
a log-probability, which is more relevant to information theoretic
quantities.
